### 1. **Detailed Memory Management**

- **Memory Fragmentation Simulation**: Introduce fragmentation in memory allocation and demonstrate how memory can become fragmented over time, affecting performance.
- **Garbage Collection**: Implement a mechanism to periodically free unused memory, mimicking real-world memory management systems.

### 2. **Advanced CPU Simulation**

- **Multi-threading**: Simulate multi-threading behavior in CPUs and show how different threads affect memory usage and performance.

- **Task Scheduling**: Implement a task scheduling algorithm (e.g., round-robin, priority scheduling) that influences how tasks are executed on the CPU.

### 3. **User Interface**

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a simple GUI to visualize device status, memory usage, and CPU load in real-time.

- **Interactive Console**: Allow users to input commands to manipulate memory, create devices, and visualize their status.

### 4. **Real-world Scenarios**

- **Benchmarking**: Create benchmarking tests to measure the performance of different devices and configurations.

- **Load Testing**: Simulate high-load scenarios where multiple devices are performing intensive tasks to observe the effects on memory and CPU.

### 5. **Network Enhancements**

- **Latency Simulation**: Introduce network latency and packet loss to see how devices respond to unreliable network conditions.

- **Data Syncing**: Develop a feature where devices can sync their memory state with a central server or cloud storage.

### 6. **Persistence Enhancements**

- **Version Control for Memory States**: Implement a mechanism to save multiple versions of persistent memory states, allowing for rollback and comparisons.

- **Error Recovery**: Add error recovery mechanisms when loading or saving memory states, handling corrupted files gracefully.

### 7. **Testing and Documentation**

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your classes and methods to ensure reliability and prevent future bugs.

- **Documentation**: Create thorough documentation for your codebase, explaining how to use the simulation and detailing the architecture.

### 8. **Additional Features**

- **Power Management Algorithms**: Implement different power management strategies (e.g., sleep modes, hibernation) that influence memory and CPU behavior.

- **Resource Limiting**: Add a feature to limit memory and CPU usage for specific tasks or devices to mimic real-world resource constraints.

### 9. **Extensibility**

- **Plugin Architecture**: Design your system in a way that allows for easy addition of new device types or memory management strategies.

- **Configurable Parameters**: Make parameters like RAM size, CPU cores, and cache size configurable through a configuration file or command-line arguments.

### 10. **Logging and Monitoring**

- **Event Logging**: Implement logging to keep track of memory usage, CPU load, and device state changes over time.

- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to visualize system metrics in real-time, allowing for better understanding and analysis.
